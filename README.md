This is a companion web app for the board game [Tiwanaku](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/267979/tiwanaku) by [Sit Down! Games](https://sitdown-games.com/produit/tiwanaku/).

It's currently hosted [on GitHub Pages](https://carlodepieri.github.io/tiwanaku-web/).

It can generate a random setup for the game, and also provide a way to track the board state during play, effectively replacing 
the wheel. This prolongs the life of the game, as only a limited number of setup disks are provided in the box.

The UI is designed to be mobile-friendly, so you can use it on your phone or tablet during play.

## How to use it

Open the [web app](https://carlodepieri.github.io/tiwanaku-web/) on your device, and click on one of the two board size 
buttons to generate a random setup. Use the provided hints to set up the board on your table and start playing. Remember
you can simply generate a new board if you don't like the starting hints!

Depending on your device screen size, you may obtain a better experience by using the app in landscape mode: so make 
sure to experiment what works better for you by rotating your device.

To discover a field or to divine its crop, you have to click (or touch) & HOLD on the field of your choice. This is to
prevent accidental reveals!
